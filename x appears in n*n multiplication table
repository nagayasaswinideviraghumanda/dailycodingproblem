Suppose you have a multiplication table that is N by N. That is, a 2D array where the value at the i-th row and j-th column is (i + 1) * (j + 1) (if 0-indexed) or i * j (if 1-indexed).Given integers N and X, write a function that returns the number of times X appears as a value in an N by N multiplication table.

n=int(input())
x=int(input())
c=0
if(x>n*n or x<0 or n<0):
    print("0")
else:
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        for j in range(1,n+1):
            if(i*j==x):
                c+=1 
    print(c)
