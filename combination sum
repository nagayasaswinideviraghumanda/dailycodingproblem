Find all valid combinations of k numbers that sum up to n such that the following conditions are true:Only numbers 1 through 9 are used.Each number is used at most once.Return a list of all possible valid combinations. The list must not contain the same combination twice, and the combinations may be returned in any order.

from itertools import combinations
class Solution:
    def combinationSum3(self, k: int, n: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        l=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
        f=[]
        r=combinations(l,k)
        for i in r:
            if(sum(i)==n):
                t=list(i)
                f.append(i)
        return f
